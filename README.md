# react-cowsay

A react wrapper for [cowsay-browser](https://github.com/bushmango/cowsay-browser)

## Usage

```js
<Cowsay>I'm a cow!</Cowsay>
```

## Development

The development environment is already setup and ready to go (hot-loading and linting included!)

1. Build only your library component/components in /src folder (this is what will be published to npm)
2. Rendering for testing/development should be done in /site/src (this can also be used as a static site for examples, docs, etc.)
3. `yarn start` or `npm start`

## Testing

Tests are written in the `/test` directory, using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest), and [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
